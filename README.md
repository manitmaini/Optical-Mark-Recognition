# Optical-Mark-Recognition
In this study, a rapid, reliable, and low-cost approach for recognizing and evaluating multiple-choice test marks on images generated by scanning optical forms printed on a regular sheet of paper with an ordinary scanner is proposed. This technology is known as optical mark recognition, and it is the process of capturing data on multiple-choice forms. The image processing library OpenCV was used to create the recognition application, which was written in the Python programming language. When the answer sheet is imported into the application, erroneous answers are highlighted in red, while correct answers are highlighted in green, and the result is written on the optical form image after the calculation of the correct/incorrect answers and blanks. This is a cost-effective, quick, and effective way. 105.750 optical forms were scanned with a scanner as a result of three examinations in Konya with 35.250 students participating. The success rate of recognition was calculated to be 99.76 percent. In terms of accuracy, reliability, and performance, empirical experiments have revealed that the proposed system outperforms traditional optical mark recognition systems.
